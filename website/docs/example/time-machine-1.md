## Summary

Write a short overview of what will be covered in the document. This may be
edited later as the case study develops, ultimately becoming the "executive
summary" (if applicable).

## Introduction

Provide some background about the organisation/project and context to orientate
readers and arouse their interest.

## Context

- Historical & organisational context
  - About the organisation
  - Vision, mission, values, ...
- Technological context

## Goals and Requirements

Given the context, what were the goals and requirements? These are likely to be
more specific than the vision, mission and values of the organisation and have
some link to the use of free software.

## Implementation

In brief, learners want to know "what does it take?", what were the challenges,
how were they overcome, what did you do right, what would you do differently? If
possible, include examples of planning, analysis, design, monitoring and
evaluation documents/reports.

This section will vary according to the nature of the case study. For some, a
"Design" section might be appropriate along with coding, testing and/or systems
integration activities ("Implementation"). For others, it might be all about
"Deployment", etc. The following suggest some aspects to consider:

- Planning/ Implementation strategy
  - Costs/benefits
  - Technical: hardware, software (development/ installation/ ...), connectivity
  - Change Management
  - User Acceptance Testing
  - Training
- How did it go? As planned?
  - Progress Reports
  - Evaluation Measures and Impact
  - What worked, what didn't and how was (or may) the process be improved?
    - What would you do differently if asked to do it again?

## Current status

Outline the current situation if the project is on-going emphasising the
continuing role of free software.

## Lessons Learned

Are there any general principles which may be derived from the experience of
this case study?

- Which lessons learned may apply more generally?
- Best/good practices, dos and don'ts.
- Cross-reference similar experiences.
