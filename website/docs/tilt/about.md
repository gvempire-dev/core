# About TILT

UNCONDITIONAL LOVE AND TIME TRAVEL — WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

Here are some definitions we use at TILT.

Unconditional love = compassionate connection to and acceptance of what is in
oneself and others, with no strings attached and no expectation of return.

Time travel = moving mental, informational and/or physical aspects of a person
into the future or the past, so the person’s experience and the experience of
those around the person is that the person: visits a point in time that is not
the commonly accepted present **[mental or physical]**, and/or influences the
commonly accepted past **[mental or informational]**, and/or receives
information about the commonly accepted future **[informational]**.
