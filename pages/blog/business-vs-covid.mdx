We were checking up on some of our favorite local businesses and noticed that many websites are down and most businesses are closed.
In a time where social distancing is the norm, we understand that times are hard right now with COVID-19.
There have been numerous studies to show the effectivness of the social distancing,
but the lack of commerce inevitably takes its toll on the economy.

For small business owners suddenly deprived of customers,
support from patrons can can spell the difference between surviving the
pandemic and closing their doors forever.

We're bringing you a few tips (outside of government aid) that could
help you make it through the other side.

### 1. Sell Gift Cards

Not only can gift cards provide you with a little extra income in these
uncertain times, they allow you customer to have an invested experience
in your company.

> "I'm conflicted about ordering non-essential goods at the moment,
> because that means a human has to pack, ship and deliver, leaving them
> open to infection. That's why I think gift certificates are best
> either for later use or for gifts,"
>

### 2. Pick up and Delivery Options

If your business models can support it, offering pick-up and delivery
options for customers to buy your products without direct contact with
your employees.

New York state, for example, is loosening restrictions on alcohol sales
so local restaurants, along with breweries and distilleries, can make
booze available for curbside pickup or delivery.

### 3. Sell Online

Sell your products or services online with services like Shopify or
Squarespace. Selling online is an excellent way to keep your employees
and your customers safe while still maintaining sales.

> in United States, this figure is expected to reach 12.4 percent in 2020.

### 4. Host Online Webinars and Classes

With everyone staying home these days, a lot of people are bored. Host
and exciting webinar or online class around your product with Zoom.
Gyms, for example have

straight through Instagram. You could host classes on making coffee,
networking with people, how to use your service or some other
fascincating mystery of life.
