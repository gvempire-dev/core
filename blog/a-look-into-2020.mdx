# Welcome to the Empire

It's been a little over a year since we banded together and created GVEMPIRE as you see it today.
It's been one long adventure since then with many different kind of projects, problems, and people.

Of course, as with all good things, there were times when everything wasn't so great.
Tight project deadlines, scope changes, and uncooperative clients are some things we don't enjoy.
These are the things that people don't show you about running their business.
We've looked back at our mistakes (as well as our wins) and tried to further develop our process in a way that keeps everyone happier.

This leads us to our first update of the year...

## A New Workflow

We've talked and listened to clients and revamped our entire process to make it easier for everyone involved.

### Notion

From now on, all of our projects start with a [Notion](https://notion.so) doc similar to this one.

[insert notion video]

Inside, you can find everything you need related to the project including.

- Project Roadmap and Timeline
- Contracts and related Documents
- Design Files
- Links/Accounts for services attached to the project

### Slack

Along with a notion document, every project will get it's own [Slack](https://slack.com) channel in our internal channel.
This allows you to have direct access to our team whenever you need them and allows us to move away from our current email/slack system and towards a more efficient workflow.

[insert slack video]

You will also have access to a [Github](https://github.com) or
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) repository where you can view in realtime
as we build out your application.

> [Schedule](https://calendy.com/gvempire/discover) your **FREE** 1-on-1 consultation.

## A New Home

Sometime in the next few weeks you're going see a new look around here.

While we all have come to love the current site at
[gvempire.dev](https://gvempire.dev), we have outgrown it's scope,
added new services, and rebranded from a static site agency.

These all add up to very large changes that the current site just can't
keep up with.

Watch out for the announcement on social media.

Which lead us on to our next update...

## New Open Source Projects

We're happy to announce two new contributions to the Open Source
Community!

`gatsby-starter-gvrecruit` and `gatsby-starter-gvsass`

For those of you that don't know what a Gatsby Starter is, you can find
out more [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/).

They're essentially a streamlined way to bootstrap common projects.

You can contribute on our [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gvempire) and view
the demos at [recruit.gvempire.dev](https://recruit.gvempire.dev) and
[sass.gvempire.dev](https://sass.gvempire.dev).

Feel free to open issues, and contribute with your ideas.

## Behind the Scenes

This year, we want to bring you a closer look into GVEMPIRE.

> _blog posts, youtube videos, live streams and more_

We want to share what we've learned after over a year in business.
We want you to know what it's like to build software in today's climate.
We want to grow our community to more than previous clients.

If you're not already, be sure to follow us on all social media platforms @gvempire.

We look forward to seeing you!

That's all we have for now. We hope you're having a fantastic year.

We'll see you on the other side.
